# Not_a_virus
Its still not officially stable game, i have not handled many specific cases where this might fail, but in ideal scenarios it should work.
## Introduction:
This is nothing but a super simple game made using python, our task is to find a specific key that was generated one entering the name of the player, to find the key there are two methods. If u want to play it just download the exe file run it and play the game and come back for solution(if needed).
### Important:
If running on Windows(preferred), make sure to add the directory of the executable, an exception in Virus and Threat Protection Settings, as Windows considers this file as a virus due to its working methods (dont worry, its not)
## Working:
The code creates a new directory called ```key_also_lives_here``` and inside it you find two files, one executable ```try.exe``` and one text file ```more.txt```. When you run ```try.exe```, 200 some new files are created whose code is actually visible to you. Your task is to then check every file/try ur luck at a file until u get anything new, you may be lucky and find the key/hint directly or u may guess random numbers appearing and see where it takes you, make sure there is the ```more.txt``` also which is also important in that. Ultimately, it all comes down to either guessing till u get it or actually observing the clues given throughout the process.




## The Answer lies below:


## Answer:
All the windows in the game are not resizable except one, there is the key.
### How to get to it:
After the 200 some files are created click any one, and see the five number guess any one and run that file next, keep on doing so until u get a text message. Rememeber the index of that file and see ```more.txt```, There u will get the index of a another file, run that one and copy the coded message and decrypt the message using the decrypter function given in code of previous file u were meant to remember, the encription key will be either of the indexes of there two special files or 69(its random), Then after decrypting, u will get index of the final file(i swear) , where u will finally ~~get the key~~ get the hint to the key, which was that it was hidden in the first windows after u submitted ur name. The key is the sum of ascii values of the characters u put in as ur name, hint to which can easily be found throughout this process.
### Why?
Only excuse i have for creating this is a had a lot of time,


If it doesnt work, plz review any error in code or try running raw .py file provided
